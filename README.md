This is a minimal Clone of Google Keep developed using React, JSX and React Hooks and styled using CSS and Material Design. <br />
Google Keep is a note-taking app, and some of the features I've replicated include creating and deleting notes. 
<br /><br />
It won't be stored as I've not used any backend yet. <br />
I've developed only the front-end part of the website. So, once you refresh the notes will disappear.
<br /> <br />
